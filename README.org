* Introduction

This script is my attempt to keep a reminder of how to create secure buckets on AWS S3.

** How to use it?

Fulfill the credentials and the filepath and execute the following code in your shell.

#+NAME: simplest_ruby_way_to_aws_s3
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
AWS_KEY='your key' AWS_SECRET='your secret' AWS_BUCKET='your bucket' bundle exec cp2s3.rb /path/to/file/to/be/uploaded
#+END_SRC
